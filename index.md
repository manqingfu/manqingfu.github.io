### scpQCA
scpQCA is a casuality analysis method rooted from QCA. scpQCA uses the set covering problem algorithms inspired by Operations Research and solve the Large-N and the complex-factor problem, also improves the mvQCA in most of the situations. Here are part of the achievements is as follows:
1. Developed an open source python package named 'scpQCA' and uploaded in [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/scpQCA/#files);
2. Obtained the computer software copyright registration of the National Copyright Administration of the PRC. The official inquiring website is as [website of CPCC](https://register.ccopyright.com.cn/publicInquiry.html?type=softList&registerNumber=2021SR2060422&keyWord=%E5%9F%BA%E4%BA%8E%E9%9B%86%E5%90%88%E8%A6%86%E7%9B%96%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95%E7%9A%84QCA%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85%E5%8C%85%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6&publicityType=ALL&registerD), which needs to register in before inquire. If the address is unaccessible, the printed certification is as [attached file](RJ20210178-基于集合覆盖算法的QCA安装包软件-证书.pdf) while the content is in Chinese;
3. scpQCA: An innovation in QCA method. [workingpaper](.pdf)
4. monadic: influences of leaders' personality. [working paper](.pdf)
5. PRC or PCS (if possible). [working paper](.pdf)

### ABM in GIS
ABM is a newly developed method in complex decision analysis and complex system research. GIS is the Geographic Information System contains variety of the reality informations. Processing the agent based model on the GIS can simulate the happened issues and predict the unprecedented cases. The skill tree of the ABM based on GIS is as follows:
1. Utilize [‘OSMnx’](https://pypi.org/project/osmnx/) to read the real geographic information in the [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=11/31.2211/121.5934) database and convert it into network format.
2. Use ['mesa'](https://pypi.org/project/Mesa/) to build a multi-agent concurrency model, and do a preliminary statistical analysis on the results.
3. TODO: Visualize the proper cases on [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) system. A sample is as [link](todo)
